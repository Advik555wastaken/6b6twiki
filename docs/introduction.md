## About 6b6t
---
6b6t is the largest Minecraft anarchy server, running on modified Folia server software that, along with other optimisations, allows 1000 players to be online at the same time in the same world world. Just like other anarchy servers, it has no rules, no punishments and no chat filters, but, unlike other anarchy servers it has /tpa and /home, the reasons for this are explained [here](https://blog.6b6t.org/about-6b6t/). 6b6t is owned by [Qbasty](./Players/qbasty.md) and was started on January 16th, 2022, and has merged maps with 7b7t. It was created with the hopes of being the largest lag-free anarchy server with no queue.
