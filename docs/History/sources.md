## Original (Discord) messages on 6b6t wiki's server
### DSNS's version
>According to the website, `6b6t` was created in 2022 but according to DSNS it was created atleast before July 2019, the time when Leeewith3Es was the owner and DSNS joined, proof is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaW-yZpxiqk) YouTube ad released on July 18th 2019. The server was kinda active, nowhere near the player count it is today.  There was a bunch of admin abuse, the user `TheTroll2001` had OP perms.  
>The `6b6t` domain was actually taken from Leee without his permission.  
>He explained it in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQfO_RxcHxI), Leee went on to create `6b6t.co`.  
>DSNS quit the server for a while so someone needs to fill in the info after Leee sold it.  
>It seems to this day he doesn't like qbasty or `6b6t`.
>I also think that qbasty reset the server/world jan 16, 2022, the day it started (according to the website)

>i can try to fill you guys with information about 6b
>the first thing is that the current `6b6t` website is lying, `6b6t` is much older than 2022, it was actually created at least before july 2019.

>i believe Leeewith3E was the owner during 2019, when i first joined the server
>he released an ad for `6b6t` july 18 2019 on his channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaW-yZpxiqk

These are replies to the above message

- <ins>North</ins>: leee made the server because someone else bought 0b0t after the domain expired, after that it was passed to bleepo in 2020
- <ins>DSNS</ins>: yea the wiki post i linked has pretty much everything
- <ins>North</ins>: oldfag had stuff to do with 6b as well https://oldfagdotorg.fandom.com/wiki/6b6t.org

>it all started when qb abandoned oa and said 6b would surpass 2b by miles  
>it did get alot of players it kept a steady 100-150 playerbase for a while then theres this two cool guys called normal cat and cipher  
>cat was a previous owner of 6b  
>and cipher was an admin  
>when the server got reworked both of them got backstabbed by qb by stripping them of their roles  
>then they tried to expose this admin on 6b called hop for being a pedophile  
>and pistonmaster stepped in and defended the so called pedophile  
>so cipher called piston out also for defending a literal pedo  
>both got banned and they made a server  
>in discord  
>to talk about gathering evidence to expose 6b cause at that time  
>qb was talking to a guy  
>and said he would give him money to get 6b botted  
>but in the end qb never paid so the guy stopped botting and started to join cipher and cat  
>also the downfall of 6b was also caused by retarded decisions  
>also there was this one time 6b went below 0.1 tps and it got so unplayable  
>chat started to get spammed like crazy  
>they made it so you can pay for higher dupe chances  
>and like that was really not cool so the community started to get mad cause its p2w  
>but qb did eventually revert the changes  
>after cipher and cat broke off 6b qb hired randos like ollie and nixter17  
>he got later doxxed by thetroll2001  and left 6b6t because he admin abused   
>didnt ollie leave 6b cause he wasnt being paid  
>by qb and he got tired of his shit  
>that and because also what happened with nixter
