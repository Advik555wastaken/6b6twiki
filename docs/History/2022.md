qbasty after getting the domain 6b6t.org, started a new anarchy server under that domain in January of this year. This caused conflict between qbasty and Leee. Qbasty then started buying other anarchy server's domains and pointing them to 6b6t.org, such as 7b7t.me, simpleanarchy.org, 10b10t.org and more.

The server ran on 1.12.2 until December 2022. In December, the server was updated to 1.19.2 MultiPaper, thanks to Xymb, the owner of endcrystal.me, joining the admin team.
