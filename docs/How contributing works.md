This website was built so that creating a markdown (.md) file in the docs folder will make a new page. Making a new folder makes a new dropdown in the sidebar and making a new markdown file in that folder makes an entry in that folder's dropdown. You can modify folders and files by cloning/forking the [GitHub](https://github.com/CubeBeveled/6b6t-wiki/) repository.

## What are markdown files?
Markdown files have the extension of .md, and are like HTML as they let you edit the way text looks. For example; you can make a text **bold** ,*italic*, <ins>underlined</ins> and much more. Learn more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PPWWRV6gbA&t=60s)

## I have made changes to a file, now what?
Make a pull request to the GitHub repository, if it gets accepted it will get merged with the project and automatically built and deployed on vercel


## I cant do this, Is there any hope?
If, for whatever reason you cannot complete the instructions you can ask one of the people on the 6b6t times discord who work on the wiki to create the md file, all you have to do is write the page in regular english.
