## Recent History
Saviors was in its top form around late 2024, there was an influx of players around November 2024 with many projects underway. That was until 18th of December, where 104 went on a rampage of griefs, griefing 7 bases and stashes, this included the Saviors Christmas Base that was being built for the Christmas competition. However, Saviors still remained intact and with new members coming in, they managed to grief 2 555 bases. Saviors was getting a massive influx of members and interest. They countinued to do well however the owner at the time (Iced Cave) was becoming less and less active, leading to many internal issues. Then on 8th of March 2025  EVERY  saviors base was greifed, by 555 and 104, currently it is not known exactly how but many point towards one of the high council being an insider. This led to the deletion of saviors discord & the private discord being made public by 555 and aitana.
