## History
Saviors/Tesseract was another rename of one of the most controversial clans on 6b6t with "New Revolution" being it's first name of many. 

New Revolution was founded by 3 individuals known as DataDrop, patosogamer, and PollyNeedCrack. The "New Revolution" was soon rebranded to "Tesseract", PollyNeedCrack was the owner of the discord server but then transferred it to patosogamer and then left/got kicked out of Tesseract due to internal clan drama. PollyNeedCrack then went on to leak multiple bases/stashes of Tesseract to scarthebest1943 for him to grief.

Players across the community but mainly 555 and members from the group which had not existed at the time, 104 expressed disaproval of the group which led to Advik555 insiding and griefing the group

scarthebest1943 then proceeded to make this [video](https://youtu.be/FI5ZHRTy6kk?si=vOoA1Glm69BAPUn8) after griefing Tesseract's main base and stash which also exposed info on the strange behaviors of tesseract members like KeprisNexus

Tesseract members/leaders went on with playing 6b6t as they normally would for the next month as Advik555 continued to inside their group and obtain many of their bases under [555 clan](https://6b6t-wiki.vercel.app/Groups/104) which coordinated with [104](https://6b6t-wiki.vercel.app/Groups/104) to nuke their discord server and grief all of their bases, proceeding to make another [video](https://youtu.be/gfk33GHCQKU?si=hbUaI37SUaD7I77N) which again showed tesseract owners using extorsion and doxxing to get their way

By this time Tesseract leaders and members were fed up with [555](https://6b6t-wiki.vercel.app/groups/555) and [104](https://6b6t-wiki.vercel.app/Groups/104) griefing them constantly, and the bad publicity they were receiving so in a attempt to start on a clean slate they rebranded to Eclipse, which also ended up being griefed in just over a month with [scarthebest1943](https://placeholder.org) making this [video](https://youtu.be/cweJk6zupDY?si=uuDQTVaEEu4M36kC)

Tesseract then thought it was going to be a good idea switching back to their second name "Tesseract" which also didn't end well with [104](https://6b6t-wiki.vercel.app/Groups/104) griefing them again on one of their member's accounts known as KeprisNexus. scarthebest1943 then uploaded this [video](https://youtu.be/YORdPtE0aN0?si=pd_XpCzLZMYj0_CV).

Tesseract then continued to play normally hoping that they wouldn't be griefed again but to their surprise in just under a month all of their bases and stashes were griefed once again, with their discord also being nuked. hokindo9000 then edited the 5th tesseract [video](https://youtu.be/b5GKXLeJRis?si=eYCKsArLkHNHMtZv)

Tesseract leaders then decided to rebrand to saviors for the same reasons as before.

Saviors was in its top form around late 2024, there was an influx of players around November 2024 with many projects underway. That was until the 18th of December, where [104](https://6b6t-wiki.vercel.app/Groups/104) went on a rampage of griefs, griefing 7 bases and stashes, this included the Saviors Christmas Base that was being built for the Christmas competition. However, Saviors still remained intact and with new members coming in, they even managed to grief two 555 bases. 

However players from 555 discovered that saviors were secretely building a very large spawn logo and completely griefed the logo using a little help from 104 and thm (this later created the group owned by Advik555 now known as "Air Destroyers"

They continued to do well however the owner at the time (Iced Cave) was becoming less and less active, leading to many internal issues. Then on 8th of March 2025 EVERY saviors base was greifed, by 555/104, currently it is not known exactly how but many point towards one of the high council members being an insider. This led to the deletion of saviors discord & the private discord being made public by 555 and aitana (etienne200296).
