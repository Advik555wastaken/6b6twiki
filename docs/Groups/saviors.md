## Recent History
Saviors was in its top form around late 2024, after 2 massive 555 stashes getting greifed, saviors was getting a massive influx of members and interest. They countinued to do well however the owner
at the time (Iced Cave) was becoming less and less active, leading to many internal issues. Then on 8th of March 2025 ** EVERY ** saviors base was greifed, by 555 and 104,
currently it is not known exactly how but many point towards one of the high council being an insider. This led to the deletion of saviors discord.
