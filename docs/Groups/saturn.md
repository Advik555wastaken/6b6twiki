## Saturn Empire
> Saturn Empire was founded by **Aze** in June 2022 and was deleted in September 2022, the most active members of Saturn Empire made a group chat which included, **Aze**, **Emilsen**, **Fulgur**, **Randy**, **Wildy**, **Kaneki** and **Denial**. After a few months **Fulgur** started screensharing on 6b6t in the group chat which made **Aze** and **Wildy** join him playing on 6b6t.

## Saturn 6b6t
> On May 30th, 2023 **Fulgur**, **Aze** and **Wildy** made a 6b6t clan called 'Saturn 6b6t' at first only at the Saturn Original Base growing the member count to around 5~ new recruits before leaking the coordinates to the Saturn Original Base and starting construction on the bigger Saturn Main Base. To grow Saturn 6b6t's discord, adbots were made to advertise free kits if you were to join the Saturn's discord, eventually a kitbot was made by **Fulgur** to automate kit deliveries but kit deliveries were shut down after a few weeks.

> Saturn Main Base was active and had around 20~ Saturn members with access to the base until the Saturn owners decided to self-grief all Saturn bases due to a member named goxdev attempting to use the bases to join Laggang, and the Saturn clan in it's peak had around 30~ members and a discord server with around 360 members.

> After the Saturn Main Base was griefed a purge in members was held and construction on a new base begun but remained unfinished and eventually Saturn became inactive around the start of 2024. **Wildy** gave ownership of Saturn's discord server to **bd71legend** who wanted to use the discord for his new clan 'Tesseract' but eventually lost access to the account with ownership.

## Oxploit
> In late 2023, when Saturn was inactive the owners of Saturn made a new Anarchy Server named Oxploit that saw peak activity of 18 players before shutting down in August 2024 due to inactivity.

## Saturn 2024 revival
> Most of the time was spent working on a web/mobile app the owners were developing called 6b6tdb, this revival died after a few days.

## Lambda 2025
> Lambda was a attempted revival of Saturn in february 2025 but with the additional owners **bd71legend**, **mortex** and all-members of what used to be Saturn Empire, but it died after **Fulgur** decided to grief Lambda Base and Saturn Main Stash leading the clan's discord to be deleted by **Aze** due to all of it's progress in the past few years being destroyed.
