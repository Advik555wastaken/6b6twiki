# How do i help?

## Creating a new page
1. Write up an md file (its super simple, in fact this is an md file). [This](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) website is helpful.
2. Request an addition of your .md file using a ["Pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) in the "docs" folder (use the correct subfolder for clans/players)
3. Wait for the admins of the 6b6t wiki to review it

## Fixing a page
1. Look for the page you want to correct(it should be in the "docs" folder)
2. Use any text editor to fix it (If you are just adding info or fixing a mistake you shouldnt have to mess with formatting/learn how to use md but using [This](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) website is still benificial
3. Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
4. Wait for the admins of the 6b6t wiki to review it
